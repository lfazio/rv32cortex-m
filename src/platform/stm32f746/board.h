 * board.h - What changes when the board does.
 *
 * Everything behind this interface is a fact about the silicon and the
 * PCB: which oscillator, which PLL dividers, how many flash wait states,
 * which USART the ST-LINK's virtual COM port is wired to, and whether the
 * core has caches to turn on. Nothing here knows the emulator exists.
 *
 * The split exists because those facts are the entire difference between
 * the two supported boards, and they were previously interleaved with the
 * emulator glue in main.c -- so porting meant reading 800 lines to find
 * the forty that mattered. A Nucleo-144 putting its VCP on USART3 rather
 * than USART2 is exactly the kind of detail that hides there and produces
 * a board that runs and says nothing.
